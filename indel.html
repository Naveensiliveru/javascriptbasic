    A computer is an electronic device that was discovered by Charles Babbage. He is known as the father of computers. There are various parts to a computer. The four major parts of a computer are the mouse, keyboard, monitor and CPU. With computers, we can send and receive messages through emails and save important information. It helps to store and modify data. Nowadays, computers are used in schools, banks, offices, etc., and it is now impossible to survive without computers. In order to run any organisation, institution, or any other office, a computer is a must. Computers have made life easier for people of different age groups.

    A computer is one of the best man-made creations that has been developed to help people in various sectors. It has become such an important part of our lives that we find computers everywhere we go. Starting from our school life till our old age, we have many uses for computers. We have become so much dependent on computers that we are using computers for almost everything we do. It is a device that can store an enormous amount of data in it. We are so much dependent on computers that we do not want to put any pressure on ourselves. We blindly store all our data in a computer with a safety passcode. A computer takes up the responsibility and processes the output in no time, hence making our life easier. It collects the data, processes it and then provides the final result to us within a very short time. People in this day and age have become so reliant on computers that they cannot imagine life without them. Computers are significant because of their widespread use, productivity, and openness. Computers are the most needed innovation due to their incredible benefits. Computers are used in every field, like the education sector, hospitals, hotels, etc. If you go for a CT Scan, X-ray, or ECG, you will need a computer to check your body. In case you want to submit a project, you will need a computer. It has become a part of our lifestyle.
    
    The computer is a remarkable piece of science that man has created to help humanity. Computers are in charge of today’s reality, and they have unquestionably altered people’s lifestyles and the condition of developing countries.
